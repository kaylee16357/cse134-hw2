  <section id="intelligence">
    <h2>I am <em>Intelligent</em></h2>
    <p>I am a fourth year mathematics and computer science major at the <b>University of Califonia: San Diego</b>. I have taken many diverse classes studying 
      everything from algorithms to combinatorics. My favorite classes include my advanced data structures class which taught me how to use C++ and create better 
      performing data storage containers and my cryptography course where I learned how to code and decode messages efficently and mathematically. I hope to 
      continue my learning by earning a masters soon. </p>

  <section id="resilient">
    <h2>I am <em>Resilient</em></h2>
    <p> One thing that I learned growing up was to never give up. I grew up in a home where neither parents were college educated, as a result of this my parents did not make a lot of money and we grew up somewhat poor. However, my parents always encouraged me to work hard and I was able to 
    attend college debt free through scholarships and grants. I hope to continue this hard working by earning a master's and being able to graduate with that debt free as well.</p>

  <section id="active">
    <h2>I am <em>Active</em></h2>
    <p>I am a vey active person. My main hobby includes going out to Imperial Sand dunes during desert season to ride my quad in the dunes. I also enjoy going to the gym to keep me confident and healthy as well as to relieve stress.
