  <p>This is a porject that I did in my CSE 100 class which is an advanced data structures class. The goal of the project was to start with a simple text file and convert it into binary in order to compress it. In this porject we had to build the huffman tree from scratch using
    the text file and then also code the functions to actually perform the file encode. We then also had to decode the binary file back to the normal txt succesfully. Another goal of the project was to beat the runtime of the sample code to earn full points. </p>
